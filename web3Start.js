But most people are not interested in installing more applications onto their phone or computer. That is why we developed this easy QR code system. We believe that these identity kits (with little QR code stickers) are just as secure as the industry standard solutions. They also allow you to experience the new Web3 without committing to a new piece of software.",

You have likely been trained to only visit and trust HTTPS websites. You can look at your browser to see this. IPFS takes this one step further. An IPFS website (https://ipfs.io/) uses a new 'Content-Based' addressing system. So if one character on this page is changed, the entire address will change.",
