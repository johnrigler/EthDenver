But most people are not interested in installing more applications onto their phone or computer. That is why we developed this easy QR code system. We believe that these identity kits (with little QR code stickers) are just as secure as the industry standard solutions. They also allow you to experience the new Web3 without committing to a new piece of software.",

An IPFS website (https://ipfs.io/) uses a new 'Content-Based' addressing system. So if one character on this page is changed, the entire address will change.",
