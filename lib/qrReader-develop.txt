I need a reader that will tell us if a QR code is rotated. This data is usually lost in
the detection process. Here is where the code would likely need to change:


https://github.com/zxing-js/library/blob/master/src/core/aztec/detector/Detector.ts

Line 214:

for (let shift = 0; shift < 4; shift++) {
            if (Integer.bitCount(cornerBits ^ this.EXPECTED_CORNER_BITS[shift]) <= 2) {
                return shift;
            }
        }

This "rotation factor" will make the code significantly safer by increasing 
the level of randomness.

From Keir:

You're looking at n-choose-k with the order being important (you don't just chuck them in a bag). Check out pages 160-164 of Move Over Brokers if you want a detailed explanation, but here goes:

In general, for the first choice you have n, then n-1, and so on down to n-k+1. And you multiply to get the total number of choices. So for 9 choose 4, it's 9*8*7*6, or more generally 9!/(9-4)!, which is 3024.

If each sticker has two sides, then you've chosen one of 3024 possible stickers. Now you have 2*2*2*2 ways of selecting the side of each sticker. So it's 16*3024, or 48384 possible combinations.

54 double-sided and rotating, pick any 8 and you get 1.7 * 10^17
